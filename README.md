# My-AI-idea
This repository contains an idea of my AI and how it could be used.
## ## Summary:
I have a few AI ideas namely Natasha, Jarvis, and AVA
Natasha:
It is my personal AI which helps to track health and also calculate potential illness and develops a chart of diet to improve health and recommends healthy habits to have a better life and stress management. Also, it filters spam calls and also decides how necessary a call to me to attend it or not.
Jarvis:
Its full form is Just Another Revolutionary Varun's Intelligent Spectre and it is used to increase the productivity of the company and also checks the stock market all time and does predictions to invest in which stock and when to sell it. I also plan to use it to create my game by giving it the template and it creates the game on its own.
AVA:
Its full form is Another Varun's AI it is an AI that generates music on its own and helps artists to create better music and modify their pre-existing music. It can also create music videos by creating a script on its own and taking a deep analysis of a human body and creating motion on the screen. It can also create a sequel to a pre-existing movie. This AI will be used in my VIBE music app.
Problems these AI will solve:
These AI will help to boost productivity and automate work and make it easy.
These AI will help to develop quality content.
How is it used:
These will be used my highly busy scheduled people to make free time or to let them concentrate on other things.
Limitations:
These AI require a high resource and processing power.
Due to their high capabilities, they might not be able to be affordable in the market.
